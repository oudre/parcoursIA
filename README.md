Sampling, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and digital filters.

**Session 2 : Introduction to Statistical Signal Processing.**<br>
Basic statistics, autocorrelation function, Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimators and spectrogram.

**Session 3 : Time series models**<br>
Signal+noise model, sinusoidal model, trend+seasonality model and autoregressive models.

**Session 4 : Representation and dictionary learning**<br>
Notion of sparsity, sparse coding (l0 and l1), dictionary learning.

**Session 5 : Pre-processing**<br>
Denoising, detrending, removal of impulsive noise, interpolation and change point detection.

**Session 6 : Feature extraction and selection**<br>
Classical feature extraction, unsupervised feature selection with PCA, supervised feature selection (filter, wrapper and embedded methods).

**Session 7 : Pattern detection and extraction**<br>
Distances between time series (Euclidean, normalized Euclidean and DTW), pattern detection and distance-based pattern extraction.
